**********************************************
JCalPro is a native Joomla! calendar component for Joomla!

JCal Pro was once a fork of the existing Extcalendar component for Joomla!
(com_extcal_0_9_2_RC4.zip from mamboguru.com).
Extcal (http://sourceforge.net/projects/extcal) was renamed
and adapted to become a Mambo/Joomla! component by
Matthew Friedman, and further modified by David McKinnis
(mamboguru.com) to repair some security holes.
